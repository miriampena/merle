merle : An erlang based memcached client.

Version : 0.3

Author : Joe Williams <joe@joetify.com>
Contributors : Nick Gerakines <nick@gerakines.net>

Info : http://github.com/joewilliams/merle/

merle uses LShift's gen_server2 module/behavior for faster message queues.
http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-server/file/b95f2fd4e3f6/src/gen_server2.erl

This code is available as Open Source Software under the MIT license.


Features:
* Support for stats, version, getkey, getskey, delete, set, add, replace, cas, flushall, verbosity, incr and decr (with specially set "counter" keys)

Notes:
* Uses term_to_binary and binary_to_term to serialize/deserialize Erlang terms before sending/receiving them. This allows for native Erlang terms to be returned from memcached but doesn't play well using other languages after setting values with merle or using merle to get values set by other languages.
* getkey and getskey currently don't work on keys initialized with addcounter/1. The binary data you get back won't be a serialized erlang integer, and so the implicity binary_to_term done by getkey and getskey provokes disaster.

Usage:

* Connecting to memcached *

Using defaults:

> merle:connect().

Set your own:

> merle:connect("HOSTNAME", 11211).


* A few operations *

> merle:set(a, asdf).
ok
> merle:getkey(a).
asdf

> merle:set(a, asdf).
ok
> merle:getskey(a).
[4,asdf]
> merle:cas(a, 4, asdfasdf).
ok
> merle:getskey(a).
[5,asdfasdf]

> merle:delete(a).
ok

* Informational commands *

> merle:version().
["VERSION 1.2.6"]

> merle:stats(slabs).
